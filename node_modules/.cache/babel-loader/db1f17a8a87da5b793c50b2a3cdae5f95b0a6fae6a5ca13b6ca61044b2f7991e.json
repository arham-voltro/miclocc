MICELOC reduces this\n              time-consuming work by up to 80%, because it provides users\n              directly with the appropriate information and combinations and\n              puts them in touch with the right contact person for direct and\n              smooth communication.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </v-col>\n      </v-row>\n      <!-- Hotel and Venue starts -->\n      <v-row class=\"mt-12\">\n        <v-col cols=\"12\" md=\"6\" class=\"d-flex align-center\">\n          <div>\n            <h1>Hotel and Venue Details</h1>\n            <p>\n              Almost no platform and even the hotels themselves provide the\n              information suitable for group events, clear, detailed and edited.\n              Often relevant data and also pictures are missing to get a perfect\n              overview.
